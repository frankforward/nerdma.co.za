<h2>ESG Overview</h2>
<p>We are a proud and responsible corporate citizen. It is our responsibility to promote responsible and sustainable
    business practices with all our stakeholders &ndash; clients, staff, society, regulatory bodies and the environment.
    This is what has earned us the trust that sustains our business.</p>
<h2>Our ESG Pillars</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Promote a positive work culture.</li>
    <li>Social and community support.</li>
    <li>Environmental Awareness</li>
    <li>Responsibility towards stakeholders (clients, employees, suppliers, shareholders and regulatory bodies)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Promoting A Positive Work Culture</h3>
<h4>Training</h4>
<p>We strive to improve the professional development of our professionals through training, both internal and external,
    seminars and other IT expos. Our training programs are industry recognized as we are MICT SETA accredited and hold
    formal partnerships with industry leaders including Microsoft.</p>
<p>As a value add for our staff and clients, we conduct monthly coding camps for our staff to introduce new concepts and
    refresh old concepts that are relevant in the industry.</p>
<h4>Equality</h4>
<p>We promote equality by giving equal opportunities to all our staff and partners. Our workplace environment is a
    non-discriminatory and non-prejudicial. Employees are encouraged to express their opinions and concerns freely
    &ndash; this is the vital for the delivery of our strategy which depends on a culture that promotes innovative ideas
    to be explored and tested.</p>
<p>Productivity, creativity, innovation, quality of service and better performance of workers, is directly related to
    the environment in which they operate. A good working climate helps to strengthen the culture that we need.</p>
<p>Discrimination and prejudice of any sort, be it against women, race, etc may stifle employees' confidence and that
    would have an adverse effect on our entity and its stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Social and Community Support</h3>
<p>As an organisation that has an entrenched learning culture, we believe in giving the youth opportunities to learn and
    grow, particular in the field of ICT. This is particularly so in our country that has a low pass rate and uptake of
    Mathematics and Sciences.</p>
<p>In today's world, digital skills are fast becoming basic necessities in all walks of life thus we take pride in
    giving the youth these opportunities. To this end, we have partnered with Afrika Tikkun, a youth empowerment NGO
    based in Johannesburg that nurtures young talent and seeks internships for them. We have some of their students on
    our internship programs, and we regularly visit the institution to give career guidance and ICT tutorials.</p>
<h3>Environmental Awareness</h3>
<p>Our employees are encouraged to be mindful of the carbon footprint that we create as we undertake our work. This
    includes basic things like avoiding unnecessary printing, efficient use of electricity, and encouraging employees to
    work remotely unless requested by clients.</p>
<p>We recently acquired a 10 ha property that will be used as our conference centre and learning hub. Our plan is to use
    renewable energy to power the facility.</p>
<p>In light of the increasing incidents of climate change, we must protect the environment and natural resources.</p>
<h3>Stakeholders</h3>
<h4>Customers</h4>
<p>Our first responsibility is to clients who use our software and other services that we provide. They are the
    cornerstone of our business. We strive to meet and transcend their needs &ndash; to be their strategic partners. As
    an ethical business, we constantly endeavour to provide value, reduce our costs and maintain reasonable prices. Our
    clients' orders are serviced promptly and effectively. They are our business partners, and they depend on us to
    deliver their strategies and make a fair profit.</p>
<h4>Employees</h4>
<p>We are responsible for our employees who deliver value to our clients. We must provide an inclusive work environment
    where each person must be considered as an individual. They must feel secure and fulfilled in their roles. Their
    unique talents must be nurtured and allowed to flourish. Compensation must be fair and adequate. Opportunities for
    growth must be availed to all deserving staff. The workplace must be safe, clean and conducive for them to be the
    best version of themselves.</p>
<h4>Suppliers and Community</h4>
<p>We are responsible for our supply chain and communities in which we live and work, as well as the broader society as
    well. We must continue to be good corporate citizens and who understand the impact of honouring their obligations
    when they fall due, especially for small businesses.</p>
<p>We must continue support good works and charities, and better the ICT adoption of our country. We bear our share of
    taxes and appreciate that they go a long way in redressing the inequality and poverty in our society.</p>
<h4>Shareholders</h4>
<p>We have a great responsibility is to our shareholders. Their investment warrants a return. Our business must make a
    sound profit to reward them for the risk they take on a daily basis. We owe it to them to innovate and experiment
    with new ideas. Research must be carried on, innovative programs developed, investments made for the future, and we
    learn from our mistakes and errors. We pride ourselves in being a are a learning organisation.</p>
<p>It is in following these ethos that, over the years, we have created shareholder value over and we will continue to
    do so.</p>
<h4>Regulatory Bodies and Governance</h4>
<p>Our final responsibility is to the compliance bodies that govern how we interact with other companies and the state.
    We pay our share of taxes and comply with other regulatory institutions including the Competition Commission and
    Compensation Fund. Our Directors understand and undertake their corporate governance responsibilities as prescribed
    by King IV, and sound financial reporting in accordance with GAAP and IFRS.</p>
