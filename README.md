Nerdma website

# Tech stack
This website is built using jekyll. The main motivation of using jekyll is to have a static website that is powered by a static file generator that makes the maintenance of the website much easier due to the templating feature of jekyll.

To update content on the website, make sure to install jekyll by following instructions for your specific OS (had to use ruby 3.1.3 as ruby 3.2.0 has issues) on the [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)  section of the jekyll website
