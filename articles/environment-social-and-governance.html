## ESG Overview

We are a proud and responsible corporate citizen committed to promoting sustainable business practices. We have committed to uphold these values to all our stakeholders including staff, clients, suppliers, communities and regulatory bodies and the physical environment. To this end, our revolutionary ESG management tool, NerdScore, has been instrumental in our ability to create, track, analyse and report our ESG initiatives.

## Environmental Stewardship

## Carbon Footprint Restrictions

We encourage our employees and third-party stakeholders to be mindful of their carbon footprint by minimising unnecessary printing, using electricity efficiently, limiting the use of fossil fuels, promoting renewable energy initiatives, and promoting remote work. This collaborative effort aims to minimise our Scope 1 â€“ 3 emissions.

## Renewable Energy Initiatives

Our recently acquired 10-hectare property, designated as our innovation centre and learning hub, will be powered by renewable energy. This initiative underscores our dedication to sustainable development and reducing our reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

## Water Conservation

As a company operating in a water-scarce country, we are conscious of our water usage and implement measures to conserve this vital resource. Our innovation centre will promote the use of recycled water and other water management systems that will be tracked by our revolutionary ESG management tool, NerdScore.

## Waste Management and Recycling

We are committed to effective waste management and recycling practices within our operations, encouraging responsible disposal and recycling of electronic and office waste.

## Climate Action

Recognising the increasing incidents of climate change, we are committed to protecting the environment and natural resources. We continually seek innovative solutions to reduce our environmental impact and promote sustainability within our operations.

## Social Responsibility

## Employee Well-being and Development

Our inclusive work environment supports each employee's personal and professional growth. We offer fair compensation, opportunities for advancement, and a safe, clean workplace, ensuring our team feels valued and secure.

Additionally, we invest in the professional growth of our staff through industry-recognised training programs, seminars, and IT hackathons. Our MICT SETA accreditation and partnerships with leaders like Microsoft enable us to offer cutting-edge training, including monthly coding camps to keep our team at the forefront of industry developments.

## Equality and Inclusion

We foster an inclusive workplace where all employees are encouraged to express their opinions and ideas freely. Our leadership and staff complement reflect the demographics of the country, promoting diversity and representation at all levels.

## Community Engagement

Our partnership with Afrika Tikkun, a youth empowerment NGO, reflects our dedication to giving back to the community. We provide internships, career guidance, and ICT tutorials to nurture young talent and enhance digital skills, addressing the critical need for STEM education in our country.

## Ethical Sourcing

We are committed to ethical sourcing practices, ensuring that our supply chain upholds the highest standards of integrity and responsibility. We maintain strong relationships with our suppliers and actively support local communities. Honouring our obligations to our suppliers is a key ethos. Furthermore, we pledge to support local suppliers, contributing to local economic and community development.

## Governance

## Ethics

We are committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics in all our business practices. Prioritising our responsibilities to clients, employees, suppliers, and the broader community is a key tenet of our organisation. This approach ensures we provide value, reduce costs, and maintain reasonable prices, fostering customer satisfaction and long-term partnerships. This dedication to ethical principles builds trust and integrity across all our operations.

## Shareholder Value

We are committed to delivering sound profits to our shareholders through innovation, research, and investment in future opportunities. Our focus on continuous learning and improvement has consistently created shareholder value.

## Data Privacy

As an ICT company, data privacy is paramount to our business. We implement robust data protection measures to safeguard client and company information, ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations.

## Regulatory Compliance and Policy Review

We adhere to all regulatory requirements, including tax obligations, competition laws, and corporate governance standards as prescribed by King IV. Our directors uphold sound financial reporting in accordance with GAAP and IFRS. We continuously review and update our ESG policies in line with evolving frameworks and best practices.

By upholding these principles, we strive to make a positive impact on the environment, society, and governance, driving sustainable success for all our stakeholders.
