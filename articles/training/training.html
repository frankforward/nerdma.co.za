    Learning plays a crucial role in our company. Everything around the organisation is
    centred around learning and continuous improvement. We live the agile way - a virtuous cycle
    of creating, implementing, learning and improving.

<p>
    We believe in the potential and enthusiasm of the youth. Through various programs that include training
    and internship, we nurture and promote their development. Nerdma is MICT SETA accredited and has a formal
    partnership with Afrika Tikkun, a youth development organisation. They provides us with young talent
    that seeks opportunities and experience in the ICT industry.

<h2 id="code-festivals-and-training">Code Festivals & Training</h2>
<p>
    We hold weekly coding classes in which we present our staff with dev tasks that sharpen
    their skills whilst bolstering their problem solving abilities. These tasks are designed
    to mimic real life software projects that we deal with on a day to day basis.
</p>

<h2 id="certification">Certification</h2>
<p>
    We conduct internal classes and one-on-one sessions that prepare staff for certification exams
    including practical assessments. Our developers are certified in a wide range of IT areas including Java,
    CISSP, C, R, AWS, Azure, SAP, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h2>
<p>
    We have a vibrant mentorship program that nurtures talent across the organisation. Our Developers
    are classified into four levels: Junior, Intermediate, Senior and Architects. Each level is mentored by
    the next immediate level which is key for mentees as they are guided by colleagues who have a deep
    understanding of their challenges and needs. Mentors understand our culture, and importantly, they
    understand their mentees. Our succession planning and tradition of continuously producing highly
    skilled and competent Developers hinges on our mentorship program.
